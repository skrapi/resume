I am a consistently curious person, who loves discovering new methods and tools, and using them to create and improve systems. I enjoy solving complex problems correctly, balancing ease of implementation with the need for future improvement. I am able to drive projects to completion by myself, but much prefer working in a team. Since leading a team, I have learned that I thoroughly enjoy helping others grow, and expand their skill-sets. By building trust within and surrounding my teams, I am able to reliably manage wide scoped projects, with hard deadlines.
