Software Development Manager, Jul 2023 – Present


I lead the Linux Kernel team in the EC2 Nitro Hypervisor organization. My team is responsible for maintaining and upgrading the kernel, as well as triaging and mitigating all security issues, both internal and embargoed. We have performed multiple LTS upgrades of our 1000+ patch set, deploying to over 6 million servers. I am responsible for both project managing the team of 7 engineers, as well as personnel and performance management. I handle promotions and performance coaching, as well as interview potential new hires.

Software Development Engineer, Aug 2021 – Jul 2023


While working as an engineer, I was responsible for developed novel dynamic memory allocation schemes for overcommitted virtual machines and developing a new MacOS based hypervisor in the EC2 Nitro system. I worked in multiple teams, on-boarding myself quickly, and also contributing on the operational side, with oncall work. I worked both in larger teams of 15 engineers, as well as in a 2-person team where all aspects of the project were handled by my colleague and I.

Embedded Software Engineer, Nov 2018 – Jul 2021


While at Plentify, I wrote the hardware abstraction layer, drivers and application code for HotBot, Plentify's hot water heater controller, as well as implemented drivers for I2C, SPI, UART, RTC, ADC, and input capture. On the application layer side, I designed and built an encrypted OTA firmware update solution, and implemented a temperature control scheme using a Finite State Machine, allowing for easier testing and validation. Finally, with my last project, implemented a subsection of the IEEE 802.15.4 WPAN stack.
